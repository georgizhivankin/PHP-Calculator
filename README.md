# PHP Calculator

This is a simple calculator written in PHP.

The calculator has the following operations built-in:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

It is an app written as part of a technical PHP test for a company, so the calculator is not very extensive and does not have a proper user-facing interface.
